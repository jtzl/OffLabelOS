EULA

OffLabel OS is experimental software and could go horribly wrong at any given
moment.  When you choose to download and/or install OffLabel OS, you accept
complete and total responsibility for your computer and yourself and you hold
harmless everyone but yourself, though you ought to forgive yourself, too;
there's no good reason to carry resentment through life.
