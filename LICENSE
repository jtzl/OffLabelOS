EULA

OffLabel OS is experimental software and could go horribly wrong at any given moment.  When you choose to download and/or install OffLabel OS, you accept complete and total responsibility for your computer and yourself and you hold harmless everyone but yourself, though you will hopefully forgive yourself, too, because there's no reason to carry resentment through life.
