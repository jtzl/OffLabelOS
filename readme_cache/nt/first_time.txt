Hey there and welcome to the bash shell.

If you're not already familiar with the shell (aka command
line interface aka terminal), open "shell_tutorial.txt" in
your Home folder first.

If you're an experienced Linux command line user already,
you will notice a couple different encrypted items on this
system; you can find the passphrases to their keys within
this image, but you have to get kind a little meta.  Hmm,
maybe I've said too much.
