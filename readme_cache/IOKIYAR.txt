IOKIYAR:  It's OK If You're A Republican.

This used to be funnier before Obama became president and basically extended
most of the more heinous policies established by his predecssor, but in any
event, IOKIYAR was slated to be a clever political comic--this is the second
strip, hence the #2.  There is a #1 somewhere with speech bubbles filled with
clever prose, but this one doesn't have any words so you can add your own.  If
you want.  Or you can inspect the file to make sure it doesn't have any
additional value to you as a budding computer forensics hobbyist.
