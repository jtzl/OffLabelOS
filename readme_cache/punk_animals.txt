Punk Animals

These are animals I had drawn a while back as part of a project that remains
unpublished, hardly in development.  But you're welcome to use these however you
see fit.  There's a cat, too, but I shamelessly kept that one to myself to sell
on the Internet--people on the Internet _love_ cat merch--I'll bet it makes $100.
