Linocut Printmaking


Linocuts are fun to cut and fun to print; they yield distinct-looking prints,
and anyone who doesn't mind cutting their own fingers a few times along the way
can do it (and it's much less painful when you use the soft rubber rather than
the hard linoleum*).











* I imagine both rubber and linoleum are environmentally disastrous; don't
  hestitate to look into woodblock printing to be more eco-friendly.
